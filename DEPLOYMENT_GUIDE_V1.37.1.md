## 📊 Database Migration

**Automatic migration runs on app start:**
- Adds `po_assignment_verified` column to `warehouse_submissions` table
- Existing submissions default to `FALSE` (need verification)
- Safe to run multiple times (checks if column exists)
- No data loss, backward compatible

**What managers will see:**
- All existing submissions show "Approve" or "Change" buttons
- PO Verification card shows count of unverified submissions
- Can approve auto-assignments or reassign to different POs
- Once approved/changed, assignment is locked

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

✅ **All existing PO assignments are preserved**  
✅ **No submissions will be lost or modified**  
✅ **Managers need to verify assignments** (new workflow)

### User Impact
✅ **Faster page loads** (less HTML, more compact)  
✅ **Better UX** (no horizontal scrolling)  
✅ **More data visible** at once  
✅ **Cleaner interface**

### Compatibility
✅ **Works with existing data**  
✅ **No breaking changes**  
✅ **All features intact**

## 🔄 Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, here's how to rollback:

git checkout v1.15.8

# Reload web app at PythonAnywhere dashboard
