__description__ = "Production tracking system for tablet manufacturing with Zoho integration, comprehensive PDF reporting, Spanish localization, photo-enabled receiving workflow, role-based access control, editable submission dates, improved Zoho API error handling, inventory_item_id-based tablet type detection. **MAJOR CHANGE v1.68**: Receive-based tracking - all submissions (Packaged, Bag Count, Machine Count) now link to specific bags in receives instead of directly to POs. Machine Count and Packaged/Bag Count tracked separately for comparison to receive bag labels. PO verification workflow removed - receives are source of truth."
