__description__ = "Production tracking system for tablet manufacturing with Zoho integration, comprehensive PDF reporting with total tablet calculations in Production Breakdown and Production by Product sections, Spanish localization, photo-enabled receiving workflow, role-based access control, collapsible dashboard with submission resync capabilities, editable submission dates, improved Zoho API error handling, inventory_item_id-based tablet type detection, fixed submission resync, reassignment to all POs (open/closed) for historical accuracy, clickable PO line items to view assigned submissions with running bag totals (tracks cumulative counts from the same bag across multiple submissions), sequential PO filling (older POs must be filled completely before newer POs receive submissions), defensive column checking for database compatibility, PO status indicators in Recent Submissions with filter toggle, reorganized Recent Submissions columns with dedicated Total and Bag Check columns, and CRITICAL FIX: removed artificial caps on PO line counts - system now accurately tracks actual production even when it exceeds ordered quantities (fixes major count discrepancy bug)"
