# Flavor-Based Bag Numbering System

**Version:** 2.11.0  
**Effective Date:** December 20, 2024

---

## What Changed?

We've updated how bags are numbered when receiving shipments. The new system is **simpler and more intuitive**.

### Old System (Box-Based)
Bags were numbered sequentially within each box, regardless of flavor:
- **Box 1**: Bag 1 (Cherry), Bag 2 (Grape), Bag 3 (Cherry)
- **Box 2**: Bag 1 (Grape), Bag 2 (Cherry)

Workers needed to remember **3 pieces of information**: Flavor + Box Number + Bag Number

### New System (Flavor-Based) ✅
Bags are numbered per flavor across ALL boxes:
- **Box 1**: Cherry Bag 1, Grape Bag 1, Cherry Bag 2
- **Box 2**: Grape Bag 2, Cherry Bag 3

Workers only need to remember **2 pieces of information**: Flavor + Bag Number

---

## For Receiving Staff

### Recording a New Shipment

1. **Select the flavor** from the dropdown (e.g., "Cherry")
2. **The system automatically assigns the next bag number** for that flavor
3. **Enter the bag count** (pills in the bag)
4. **The bag label will update** to show: "Cherry Bag 2 (Box 1)"

**Important**: Box number is still recorded (for physical location), but the system handles it automatically.

### Example Workflow

You're receiving a shipment with 3 boxes:

**Box 1 contains:**
- 1 bag of Cherry → System assigns: **Cherry Bag 1**
- 1 bag of Grape → System assigns: **Grape Bag 1**  
- 1 bag of Cherry → System assigns: **Cherry Bag 2**

**Box 2 contains:**
- 1 bag of Grape → System assigns: **Grape Bag 2**
- 1 bag of Cherry → System assigns: **Cherry Bag 3**

**Box 3 contains:**
- 1 bag of Cherry → System assigns: **Cherry Bag 4**

Notice how Cherry bags are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 across ALL boxes!

## For Production Staff

### Submitting Counts (Machine/Packaging)

When you process a bag:

1. **Select the flavor** (e.g., "Cherry")
2. **Enter the bag number** (e.g., "2" for Cherry Bag 2)
3. **Box number is optional** - you can leave it blank for new receives

### What About Old Receives?

Don't worry! Old receives (before Dec 20, 2024) still work with box numbers. The system is smart:
- **New receives**: Just need flavor + bag number
- **Old receives**: Can still use box + bag number if needed

## Benefits of the New System

### ✅ Simpler Instructions
**Before**: "Process Cherry from Box 1, Bag 3"  
**Now**: "Process Cherry Bag 2"

### ✅ Better Inventory Visibility
**Before**: To know total Cherry bags, count across boxes  
**Now**: Cherry bags numbered 1-4 = **4 Cherry bags** (immediately clear)

### ✅ Matches How You Think
You naturally think "we received 4 Cherry bags" not "Box 1 has 2 Cherry bags, Box 2 has 1..."

### ✅ Less Information to Remember
Only need to track **flavor + bag number** instead of **flavor + box + bag**

## FAQ

### Q: What if I need to know which box a bag is in?
**A:** The system still shows box number as a reference (e.g., "Cherry Bag 2 (Box 1)"). It's just not required for matching.

### Q: What happens if two receives have the same Cherry Bag 2?
**A:** The system will flag it for manager review to assign the correct receive. This is rare and managers can handle it easily.

### Q: Do I need to retrain on the old system?
**A:** No! Old receives continue to work as before. The new system only applies to receives recorded after December 20, 2024.

### Q: What if I accidentally enter the wrong bag number?
**A:** Contact your manager - they can reassign submissions just like before.
